# Semantic_Segmentation
Real-time Domain Adaptation in  Semantic Segmentation

The main objective of this project is to become familiar with the task of Domain Adaptation applied to the Real-time Semantic Segmentation networks. 
There are several steps to implement this entie project.
For each step the .pynb file is implemented and attached here.
Like for step 2, there are two files named as SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION_2a and SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION_2b.
for the step 3, there are files, Semantic_Segmentation_3a(step 3a) and step3b(Horizontal_flip), step3b_aug2(ColorJitter) and Step3b_combined_augmentation.
for the step 4, there are files named as step4_FDA and step4dacs
